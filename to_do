change size of scatter and ternary graphs to reflect the user's screen

make sure things work with Windows and MacOS

make icon something zebrabow-y!

3D scatter has some antialiasing bugs that haven't been fixed in vispy. Ignore for now.

make axes for 2D ternary plot appear and center the graph better.

add cluster plot and bar plot

add ways to modify the HDBSCAN settings (slider or text box for parameters?)

add contour plot to ternary graph

add in ability to load prior clustering solution

make clustering happen automatically with loading file? Maybe if sample size is under a certain level?

add wait dialogs to everything

evaluating clusters takes a lot of time with higher sample sizes. may want to disable this? or make it a check box?
