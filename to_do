change size of scatter and ternary graphs to reflect the user's screen

make sure things work with Windows and MacOS

3D scatter has some antialiasing bugs that haven't been fixed in vispy. Ignore for now.

write the update_parameters function

Handle all situations when nothing is selected!

When the support is there, I would like to export the 3D Vispy graph as an interactive 3D graph that could be
manipulated in powerpoint.

may still need a way of removing extreme points

add Gini coefficient??
